# concerto
A personal project developed to ease difficulties encountered when trying to find nearby concerts for artists I like. Spotify only shows upcoming shows near you for people you listen to, and Ticketmaster requires you to look up artists one at a time. Concerto allows you to paste your favorite playlist, and then filter the results based on location, price estimates, genre, and date. Users can simply take their favorite playlist and find somebody performing nearby that perfectly fits their schedule and budget, without searching for hours one artist at a time.
## Tech Stack

## Next Steps
I am working on finding a host for the website so that it may be viewed. Please note that it is still under development, and will likely still be under development when it is first hosted. When a link is available, it will be included in this README.
